## ðŸŸ¨ Howdy!
I'm skuqre *(pronounced "square")*.

I make a whole bunch of stuff about the games I like. Mostly gacha games for now, because those are what I'm playing currently.

If you like the stuff that I do, you can always star the project on GitHub!

## ðŸ’¼ Stuff I've done / doing

### [NIKKE Font Generator](https://skuqre.github.io/nikke-font-generator/)

> A site that lets you recreate fake screenshots from NIKKE.

The whole site revolves around recreating various game assets and interfaces in order to make it a template, with an interface to modify the said template. Somehow, used by lots of people! Thank you!

### [Rebuild AnisÃ©](https://skuqre.github.io/nikke-font-generator/rb-anise/)

> A NIKKE Discord Bot that provides you with (almost) everything you need.

It gets data from sites like [NIKKE.gg](https://nikke.gg/) and [Prydwen](https://prydwen.gg/nikke/), and condenses it into readable Discord messages for ease of access. Also has other features like [BlablaLink](https://blablalink.com/) integration, universal Gacha system, and much more.

This Bot is available over at [NIKKE.gg's Discord](https://nikke.gg/discord/) and at the [NIKKE Community Discord](https://discord.gg/nikke/).

### [Ultimate Scenario Creator](https://github.com/skuqre/ultimate/)

> A PowerPoint-like application that faithfully recreates the NIKKE Scenario screen. 

*Development currently paused until further notice*. Create your fanfictions, what-ifs, AU stories, as if it were in the game itself. It is currently a work-in-progress, but I'm getting there someday!

### [NKAS](https://nkas.pages.dev/)

> Just a humble asset storage full of NIKKE assets.

A [NIKKE-DB](https://nikke-db.pages.dev/) wannabe. Used mainly for the Rebuild AnisÃ© Discord bot for NIKKE assets (e.g. profile pictures, card images, full body images).

### [Anisa](https://github.com/skuqre/anisa)

> A proof-of-concept for an information aggregator built with a static site generator.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the main idea was to create a static site that would build itself everyday in order to update its data. Due to me having no access to servers and hosting, I decided to create the idea using GitHub workflows. It did work, but it just wasn't worth maintaining. Besides, this idea stemmed from me not being able to get the first iteration of Rebuild AnisÃ© running.

### [AnisÃ©](https://github.com/skuqre/anise)

> A NIKKE Discord Bot that provided helpful NIKKE information.

The first iteration of Rebuild AnisÃ©. The Bot was made with Python, using Disnake as its main library. It would get information from the same sites as Rebuild AnisÃ© is currently doing now, albeit in worse quality. She was also very slow. She was very not up-to-par with my standards at the time, so I decided to drop the project and create Anisa.
